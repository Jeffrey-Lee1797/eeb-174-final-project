Like other sites in this region (Apidima Lakonis; see Harvati et al. 2003; Panagopoulou et al. 2002e2004; Harvati et al. 2009 2011) it is a karstic cave formed in the limestone cliffside and one of the numerous caves opened in this part of the peninsula preserving Pleistocene fillings with dense Paleolithic material (Darlas and Psathi 2008). The cave is situated directly on the coast approximately 2.5 km northwest of Areopolis (Fig. 1) some 10 m from the current sea-line at 2.5 m above sea level (hereafter asl) and directly above what is interpreted as the Tyrrhenean terrace","gp_mid","","","","GR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","not reported","","","","","","","","","","cave","","","macrofossils,mesofossils","","","","","tooth marks","","","body,anthropogenic,bone collector","","","","","","","","","","","","","taxonomic","","","","","","","","","","terrestrial","","actively mobile","ground dwelling","","omnivore","viviparous","","hydroxyapatite","","",""

This is succeeded by an approximately 6-m-thick white to pinkish clayey limestone intercalated with thin red mudstone lenses that are rich in vertebrate bones including hominid fossils. The fossil-bearing horizon appears to reflect a distal alluvial fan to floodplain environment. The presence of freshwater mollusks together with an alternation of gypsum marls laminated claystones and shales in the various levels of the section indicates lacustrine deposition with fluctuating lake levels. Organic-rich levels may indicate swampy areas at the periphery of the lake (cf. Walker and James 1992; Talbot and Allen 1996) whereas lenses of sandstones with conglomerates indicate fluvial settings which probably drained the lake. ","mudstone","lenticular,red","lithified","","Y","""limestone""","nodular,red,white","","silty","","lacustrine - large","","Corakyerler contrast strongly with the mostly fluvial or alluvial fan deposits at other Turolian localities in the Greco-Iranian region. Sedimentological and faunal differences both suggest that the fossil assemblage of Corakyerler represents habitats at an ancient lake shore. The evidence supports the view that its com- munity is somehow ‘more humid’ than expected from its mean hypsodonty reflecting a locally humid setting in a more arid regional context. Corakyerler therefore shows local taxonomic and paleoenvironmental differences from the regional average as a typical Pikermian fauna and environment with a local twist favorable to hominids.","macrofossils,mesofossils","","","partial skeletons,skulls,teeth","","","","","body","","","","","","","","","","","","","biostratigraphic","field collection,observed (not collected)","","","","","","","","","terrestrial","","actively mobile","ground dwelling","","omnivore","viviparous","","hydroxyapatite","","",""
